You are required to write a Java program for the purposes of encryption.
A Command line interface is required which will allow an operator to type in some plaintext,
and it will generate ciphertext and print it to console.
The encryption to use is the Caesar cipher, with a rightshift of 1
The range of characters is 32 to 126 inclusive.
The program should be robust and recover from all reasonable exceptions and errors.

Note: There may be changes to requirements.

Pseudocode of EncryptionApp

Declare variable of type integer shiftCounter to store shift value
Declare scanner object
Declare String userInput and store next line from scan in it
Declare userChars char[] and store userInput string in it

FOR every char in userChars
	IF char >= 32 and char <= 126
		IF char == 126, make it 32
	ELSE ++char
END FOR

Print the result to the user
	
Suspect changes in requirements:
	prompt user to choose which way to shift r/l?, store result in boolean
	prompt user to how far does he wants to shift, store it in int
	depending on where to shift, call different methods passing
	character and shiftcounter, which will return shifted result
	
	
New Requirements:
1) The program should en/de-crypt Unicode decimal values 32 - 126 inclusive.

2) The user should be able to specify the shift direction and magnitude

3) Decryption is also required

4) Strings of length up to 140 characters must be catered for, >140 characters is optional
	

One method to shift every character to given magnitude both right and left

FOR every character in text
	DO increment(/decrement) of that character number of times user passed in
